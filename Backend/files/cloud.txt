Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and processing power—through the internet instead of using local computers or on-premises data centers. Rather than buying and maintaining physical hardware, users can access these resources from cloud providers whenever they need them.

One of the key features of cloud computing is on-demand availability. Resources can be quickly scaled up or down depending on usage, which makes cloud systems highly flexible and efficient. This means a company can handle high traffic or heavy workloads without permanently investing in expensive infrastructure.
